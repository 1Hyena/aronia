# Abilities ####################################################################

In Aronia both the player and non-player characters (NPCs) can possess various
abilities. Collectively these abilities are categorized into traits, skills,
spells and adaptations. While technically spells and adaptations are skills too,
for the sake of simplicity we distinguish them by their mode of use.

A skill can be executed directly by issuing its command to a character whereas
spells require the _cast_ wrapper command. Adaptations and traits, on the other
hand, are passive abilities and are not considered directly executable.
