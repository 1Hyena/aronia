## Skills ######################################################################

Skills are the abilities that a character has learned in its natural lifetime
to solve various in-game problems. Characters usually start with a small set of
their race specific bonus skills. Other skills need to be learned from special
NPCs who are also known as guildmasters.

In the following sections we list all such character abilities. Some abilities
such as weapon class handling and character class specific skills are further
divided into their own subcategories.


### Warrior ####################################################################

The following subsections are dedicated to warrior-specific skills only. Under
normal conditions these skills cannot be learned by other character classes.


#### Taunt #####################################################################

While the _taunt_ command is available to everyone, if the actor has not learned
it, the command will simply default to a set of taunting social commands with
no further effect.

However, if the skill has been learned and is sufficiently mastered, it will
enrage the target character, leaving it critically exposed for a short period of
time. Also, if the target is of a short-tempered type, then it is highly likely
that it will attack the provocateur.

This skill is not cost free though. The acting character must have a small
amount of protection to maledictions (also known as _saves_) at their disposal.
Upon successful completion, taunting will drain the actor from all of its saves.


### Cleric #####################################################################

The following subsections are dedicated to cleric-specific skills only. Under
normal conditions these skills cannot be learned by other character classes.


### Smite ######################################################################

Smiting is the special combat ability for fighting clerics. While its respective
command is available to everyone, only those who have learned this skill will be
able to use it to its fullest extent.

This skill requires the acting character to wield a mace type weapon. If that
condition has been met, it will execute a single attack with the wielded weapon.
If the skill mastery check succeeds, it will be seens as a _smite_ rather than
a regular attack.

Based on the acting character's wisdom, the chance of adding the _holy_ label to
the attack is calculated. A holy smite will do additional damage proportional to
the attacker's current wisdom.

This skill can also be prepared before use. In that case, the resulting attack
obtains the _mighty_ label, which in turn makes the attack more frightening.

If the target character is expecting the attack using the _prevent_ command, the
attack is less likely to succeed in its full power.
